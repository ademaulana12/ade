This program aims to learn how to write syntax on each programming language. 
This program is not an existing application on the desktop, but a collection 
of algorithms that are compiled to make reference to each user.

This program does not require a plugin that is written and compiled program 
without the help of plugin, if you want to add or change the program please 
help us to make this tullisan to be perfect. For now the written script is 
the language of the C / C ++ and JAVA program languages.If you want to add 
another language please contact us beforehand.
